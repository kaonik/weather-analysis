# Weather Data Aggregation and Retrieval

Forecast and historical data will be retrieved from OpenWeatherMap. Data will be stored in a local PostgreSQL database. A grid of points across the US will be collected for analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.\

Table Creation contains the SQL statements for initial table creation.\

## Tentative Next Steps 

Set up data pipeline to fetch, clean, and store data in the database for historical access and real-time analysis.\
Create a dashboard for visualizing data, possible features:\
&emsp;&emsp; - Visualize data over map of US and with graphs, allow feature selection (temp, wind, humidity, etc) and time range.\
Perform basic statistical analysis and identify anomalies or trends.\
Use machine learning models to predict future weather trends.\
